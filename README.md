# Restaurant Reviews App

## Project Summary:
In this **Restaurant Reviews** project, I converted a static, non responsive webpage in to a mobile-ready web application, implemented accessibility and added a service worker to make sure it runs offline as well.

## Run the application

1. Clone this repo in you machine. In a terminal, change the current working directory to this local project. 
2. Check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`.  If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software. For windows user, open git bash and use `python -m http.server 8000`.
3. With your server running, open the browser, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
4. Resize your browser if you are willing to check the responsiveness
5. To check if it runs offline, stop the running server and reload the page

Navigate to any restaurant page that you opened while on the internet connection, they are rendered even when there is no network access.
